## Setup

To properly configure [fish-lsp](https://fish-lsp.dev), you need to define a client configuration after
installing the language server. _Client's typically only need the keys `command`,
`args/arguments`, and `filetypes` to start a language server._

### Client Configuration _(Required)_

Theoretically, the language-server should generally be compatible with almost any text-editor or IDE you prefer using.
Feel free to setup the project in any [fish-lsp-client](https://github.com/ndonfris/fish-lsp/wiki/Client-Configurations) of your choice, or [submit a PR](https://github.com/ndonfris/fish-lsp-language-clients/pulls) for new configurations.

```json
{
  "fish-lsp": {
    "command": "fish-lsp",
    "filetypes": ["fish"],
    "args": ["start"]
  }
}
```

> [Neovim](https://neovim.io) client using [coc.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) configuartion, located inside [coc-settings.json](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim/wiki/Language-servers#register-custom-language-servers) `"languageserver"` key

### Server Configuration _(Optional)_

Specific functionality for the server can be set independently from the client. This allows for multiple
configurations, to be defined and chosen via specific startup requirements  __(i.e.,__ using the `bind` command
with the _function_ `edit_command_buffer`__).__

#### Environment variables

> Generate by `fish-lsp env --create`

```fish
# fish_lsp_enabled_handlers <ARRAY>
# enables the fish-lsp handlers (options: 'asciiArt', 'formatting', 'logging',
# 'complete', 'hover', 'rename', 'definition', 'references', 'diagnostics',
# 'signatureHelp', 'codeAction', 'index')
set -gx fish_lsp_enabled_handlers

# fish_lsp_disabled_handlers <ARRAY>
# disables the fish-lsp handlers. (options: 'asciiArt', 'formatting', 'logging',
# 'complete', 'hover', 'rename', 'definition', 'references', 'diagnostics',
# 'signatureHelp', 'codeAction', 'index')
set -gx fish_lsp_disabled_handlers

# fish_lsp_commit_characters <ARRAY>
# array of the completion expansion characters. Single letter values only.
# Commit characters are used to select completion items, as shortcuts. (default: [])
set -gx fish_lsp_commit_characters

# fish_lsp_logfile <STRING>
# path to the logs.txt file (default: '~/path/to/fish-lsp/logs.txt')
set -gx fish_lsp_logfile

# fish_lsp_format_tabsize <NUMBER>
# amount of spaces in a tab character for the formatter provider (default: 4)
set -gx fish_lsp_format_tabsize

# fish_lsp_format_switch_case <BOOLEAN>
# keep case statements left aligned with switch block. (default: false)
set -gx fish_lsp_format_switch_case

# fish_lsp_all_indexed_paths <ARRAY>
# fish file paths/workspaces to include as workspaces (default: ['/usr/share/fish', "$HOME/.config/fish"])
set -gx fish_lsp_all_indexed_paths

# fish_lsp_modifiable_paths <ARRAY>
# fish file paths/workspaces that can be renamed by the user. (default: ["$HOME/.config/fish"])
set -gx fish_lsp_modifiable_paths

# fish_lsp_diagnostic_disable_error_codes <ARRAY>
# disable diagnostics for matching error codes (default: [])
set -gx fish_lsp_diagnostic_disable_error_codes

# fish_lsp_max_background_files <NUMBER>
# maximum number of background files to read into buffer on startup (default: 500)
set -gx fish_lsp_max_background_files
```

#### Command Flags

Both the flags `--enable` and `--disable` are provided on the `fish-lsp start`
subcommand. __By default, all handlers will be enabled__.

```fish
# displays what handlers are enabled. Removing the dump flag will run the server.
fish-lsp start --disable complete signature --dump 
```

#### Further Server Configuration

Any [flags](#command-flags) will overwrite their corresponding [environment variables](#environment-variables), if both are
seen for the `fish-lsp` process. For this reason, it is encouraged to wrap any
non-standard behavior of the `fish-lsp` in [functions](https://fishshell.com/docs/current/language.html#functions) or [aliases](https://fishshell.com/docs/current/language.html#defining-aliases).

Due to the vast possibilities this project aims to support in the fish shell,
[sharing useful configurations is highly encouraged](https://github.com/ndonfris/fish-lsp/discussions).

## How does it work?

If you're new to the concept of the [Language Server Protocol (LSP)](https://lsif.dev), this section should be
useful to help you grasp its core purpose and benefits.

> üì∏ Check out [this insightful video](https://youtu.be/LaS32vctfOY?si=MISP8tL_HU06-_z-) by TJ DeVries for an introduction to the subject. üì∏

The LSP is designed to create a uniform approach for supporting a programming language across
various development tools, moving beyond the confines of specific Text-Editor/IDE ecosystems.
This standardization enhances a language's appeal by allowing developers to maintain consistent
tooling support without needing to switch developer environments.

The core of this system is the interaction between a _'language server'_, which provides
language services, and a _'language client'_, which consumes these services. The protocol
facilitates this interaction, ensuring that any _language client_ can leverage a
well-defined set of features provided by the _server_.

Here is a diagram to visualize a hypothetical `fish-lsp` process:
