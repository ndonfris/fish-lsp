## Summary

A __feature-rich__, __extensible__, and __blazingly fast__ [language-server](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-languageserver-node/tree/main/server/src/common) for the [fish-shell](https://fishshell.com/).
Uses [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/), [tree-sitter-fish](https://github.com/ram02z/tree-sitter-fish), [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) and [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
Implements both standard & non-standard features from the [language-server-protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#headerPart), to be connected to a language-client ([neovim](https://neovim.io/),[coc.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim), [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [etc.](https://github.com/ndonfris/fish-lsp-language-clients)).

    > ___Currently is not recommended for use as the release binaries are error
    > prone and not fully tested. Future `tsup` builds, should provide stability
    > across different installation enviornments.___

    - navigate to the [releases](https://github.com/ndonfris/fish-lsp/master/releases), and download the file for your OS

    - Rename file to fish-lsp (make sure the binary is executable as well)

        ```fish
        # cd to downloaded location 
        mv fish-lsp-linux fish-lsp 
        chmod +x ./fish-lsp
        ```

    - move the binary to your __\$PATH__:

        ```fish
        mv ./fish-lsp ~/.local/bin/fish-lsp
        ```

    </details>


1. Provide the `fish-lsp` command to start the server from a language client
    ```json
    {
      "languageserver": {
        "fish-lsp": {
            "command": "fish-lsp",
            "args": ["start"],
            "filetypes": ["fish"]
        }
      }
    }
   ```
    > configuration shown for "coc.nvim"
    > lua and other language-client configuration syntax's 
    > can be built by fish-lsp startup-configuration <filetype>.
    > Demo shows different hover documentation, go-to definition, go-to references
    > and some other features.
