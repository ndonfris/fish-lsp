# fish-lsp

A __feature-rich__, __extensible__, and __blazingly fast__ [language-server](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-languageserver-node/tree/main/server/src/common) for the [fish-shell](https://fishshell.com/). 
Uses [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/), [tree-sitter-fish](https://github.com/ram02z/tree-sitter-fish), [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) and [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). 
Implements both standard & non-standard features from the [language-server-protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#headerPart), 
to be connected to a language-client ([neovim](https://neovim.io/),[coc.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim), [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and *etc.*). __More
