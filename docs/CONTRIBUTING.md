# Contributing :busts_in_silhouette:

The [fish-lsp](https://fish-lsp.dev) aims to create an experience that aligns with the [fish](https://fishshell.com) language goals.

In a quick overview, the project hopes to create a development environment that is as
_friendly_ as possible.

_Thanks for the interest in contributing to the project_ :pray:

## Getting started :rocket:

1. Begin by forking the project, then [build your local fork](https://github.com/ndonfris/fish-lsp#installation) :card_file_box:.

    > <details> 
    > <summary>  <b><ins>INSTRUCTIONS</ins></b>: how to build from source - <i>compiling your local version of the project</i> </summary>
    > 
    > - **Step 1:** Get the dependencies installed by running the command:
    >
    >     ```bash
    >     yarn install
    >     ```
    > 
    > - **Step 2:** Then, you can [build the project](https://github.com/ndonfris/fish-lsp#build-from-source) by running the command:
    >
    >     ```bash
    >     yarn dev # or `yarn dev:watch` for continuously recompiling the project on any changes
    >     ```
    >
    > - **Step 3:** Finally, you can verify the global `fish-lsp` command is linked to the local version of the project by running:
    >
    >     ```bash
    >     fish-lsp info
    >     ```
    >     ![](https://github.com/ndonfris/fish-lsp.dev/blob/master/public/fish-lsp-info.svg?raw=true)
    >
    > </details>

2. Once you have installed the local fork of the project (_i.e.,_ you have a successfully [compiled](https://github.com/ndonfris/fish-lsp?tab=readme-ov-file#build-from-source) `fish-lsp` executable, and have a working [client configuration](https://github.com/ndonfris/fish-lsp-language-clients)), you can then begin [testing locally](#helpful-workflows) :memo:.

3. Upon completing a change, submit a [PR](https://github.com/ndonfris/fish-lsp/pulls) :tada:.

## Places to Start :checkered_flag:

- [Roadmap](./ROADMAP.md) - _future ideas to support_
- [Issues and discussions](https://github.com/ndonfris/fish-lsp/discussions) - _get ideas from others_
- [Sources](https://github.com/ndonfris/fish-lsp/wiki/sources) - _helpful insight about potential features you want to adapt_

> [!NOTE]
> Browsing both [wiki/sources#vscode-extensions-examples](https://github.com/ndonfris/fish-lsp/wiki/sources#vscode-extension-examples) and [ROADMAP](./ROADMAP.md) are the easiest method for
> understanding how to create future [fish-lsp feature's](https://github.com/ndonfris/fish-lsp#features)

## Helpful Workflows :hourglass:

### Test Driven Development Workflow :hatching_chick:

Since __stdin/stdout__ are reserved for the protocol to communicate, a generally successful method to achieve quick results, is through [TDD (Test Driven Development)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development). Many tree-sitter helper functions ([tree-sitter.ts](../src/utils/tree-sitter.ts), and [node-types.ts](../src/utils/node-types.ts)) have already been written, to aid in providing useful functionality for generic support of any possible combination need for future types.

Having said that, if you a need for a new definition in [tree-sitter.ts](../src/utils/tree-sitter.ts) or [node-types.ts](../src/utils/node-types.ts) comes up, adding it to the proper file is fine (`tree-sitter.ts` generally deals with movement or interacting with a `SyntaxNode[] | Tree`, where as `node-types.ts` generally deals with filter functions that can determine what __type__ of `SyntaxNode` is passed into it). The only requirement is that you will for new additions to these files, is that you include proper tests in their corresponding [test-data/{node-types,tree-sitter}.test.ts](https://github.com/ndonfris/fish-lsp/blob/master/test-data/))

</details>

### Integration Testing Workflow :exploding_head:

Test directly in the [client](https://github.com/ndonfris/fish-lsp-language-clients) of your choosing. _This is a more difficult to setup_, but could be helpful if you are testing specific behaviors like the interacting with [fish-lsp's environment variables](https://github.com/ndonfris/fish-lsp/?tab=readme-ov-file#environment-variables), [configuration options](https://github.com/ndonfris/fish-lsp/?tab=readme-ov-file#command-flags), handler testing or other more specific tasks.

</details>

### How to Build using these Workflows :building_construction:

1. __Pull up__ some Documentation :microscope:
   - [lsif](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#languageFeatures) - The official Language Server Protocol specification
   - [wiki/sources](https://github.com/ndonfris/fish-lsp/wiki/sources) - Sources that are similar to this project
   - [roadmap](./ROADMAP.md) - Ideas/Documentation for future plans 

1. __Create__ a `file` in the [tests/](https://github.com/ndonfris/fish-lsp/tree/master/tests) directory :construction_worker:
    - __START WITH VERY BASIC EXAMPLES!!!__  [Pure functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function) are your friend
    - Checkout [./tests/helpers.ts](../tests/helpers.ts), `setLogger()` which is provided for `logging` tests
    - Test your `FILE.test.ts` with command: `yarn test FILE --run`
    - Feel free to overwrite _any existing `tests/` file_
    - Use `import { initializeParser } from '../src/parser` for building `SyntaxNode[]` [composite object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_pattern) arrays (aka [trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal)).
    - **(Recommended instead of directly using parser)** Use `import { Analyzer, analyzer } from '../src/analyzer'` for setting up a test suite's analyzer object, which exposes how the server actual parses input using tree-sitter. An example test suite is shown below:
    
      > ```ts
      > import * as Parser  from 'web-tree-sitter'
      > import { initializeParser } from '../src/parser'
      > import { Analyzer, analyzer } from '../src/analyzer'
      > import { TestFile, TestWorkspace } from './test-workspace';
      >
      > describe('example test suite', () => {
      >   let parser: Parser;
      >   let analyzer: Analyzer;
      >
      >   beforeEach(async () => {
      >     // In most tests, there is no reason to use the parser directly because the analyzer function wraps it
      >     /** parser = await initializeParser() */
      >     await Analyzer.initialize()
      >   })
      >
      >   // EXAMPLE to setup a test workspace with files, we can parse.
      >   // This handles creating a temporary directory, and cleaning it up after the tests
      >   // and makes sure that code related to `Workspace` and `Document`
      >   // behave the same as a normal server session expects.
      >   const workspace = TestWorkspace.create({name: 'example_folder'}).addFiles(
      >      TestFile.create('example_file.fish', 'echo "hello world"'), // example_folder/example_file.fish
      >      TestFile.function('name', 'function name; echo "hello from name function"; end;'), // example_folder/example_file.fish
      >      TestFile.completion('name', 'complete -c name -f'), // example_folder/completions/name.fish
      >   ).initialize()
      >
      >   it('example test case', () => {
      >     const doc = workspace.getDocument('example_file.fish')
      >     const { tree } = analyzer.analyze(doc)
      >
      >     // your test code here
      >     expect(tree.rootNode.type).toBe('source_file')
      >   })
      > })
      > ```

    - More examples of setting up test workspaces, in a test suite

      > ```ts
      > import { setLogger } from './helpers';
      > import { TestFile, TestWorkspace } from './test-workspace';
      > 
      > describe('example test suite', () => {
      >   setLogger(); // console.log() will be captured in test output
      >   // logger.setSilent(); // will suppress all logging output
      >
      >   describe('test workspace 1', () => {
      >     const workspace = TestWorkspace.create({name: 'example_folder'})
      >       .inheritFilesFromExistingAutoloadedWorkspace('$__fish_data_dir')
      >       .initialize()
      > 
      >      it('see files in workspace', () => {
      >        const files = workspace.getAllFiles()
      >        for (const file of files) {
      >          console.log(file.uri)
      >        }
      >        expect(files.length).toBeGreaterThan(0)
      >      })
      >   })
      >
      >   describe('test workspace 2', () => {
      >     // assuming a fish workspace exists already in `tests/workspaces/<FOLDER_NAME>`
      >     const workspace = TestWorkspace.read('test_workspace_2')
      >       .initialize()
      >
      >      it('see files in workspace', () => {
      >          const files = workspace.getAllFiles()
      >          for (const file of files) {
      >            console.log(file.uri)
      >          }
      >          expect(files.length).toBeGreaterThan(0)
      >      })
      >   })
      >
      >   /*  ... more tests ...  */
      >
      > })
      > ```

1. __Iteratively__ continue improving your feature :infinity:
    - Once you have a feature's hard coded input & outputs working as expected, you can begin trying to impalement it as an actual `server.handler`
    - You can try adding logging to your feature's specific `handlerParams`, to get an exact example of it's shape. (_This is the premise outlined via:_ [integration testing workflow](#integration-testing-workflow-explodinghead))

      > ```fish
      > # display the logs
      > tail -f $(fish-lsp info --log-file)
      > ```

    - Alternatively, you can mock the data-type from the `vscode-languageserver` or refer to the [same documentation on lsif](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#definitionParams)

1. __Add__ your feature to a [server.ts](../src/server.ts) `handler` :handshake:
    - Document your handler, if necessary. 
    - Feel free to submit your [server handler](../src/server.ts) in __separate__ working release stages, instead of trying to build entire feature's independently. (_i.e._, if your `CodeAction's` only support a singular `CodeActionType`)
    - Submit your [PR](https://github.com/ndonfris/fish-lsp/pulls) :champagne:


## Helpful Topics and Concepts :books:

[Currying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying) is a useful design pattern, that makes iterating through the [Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) significantly less error prone. 

> [!NOTE]
> While it is still not entirely perfect, errors that appear to be caused by inconsistencies
> in our [node-types.ts](../src/utils/node-types.ts) [functors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functor_(functional_programming)) are more likely to be
> caused by the earlier language server protocol versions requirement for our Nodes in our tree items, to be stored as a flat list.
> 
> Due to this reason, the project has undergone a significant rewrite of previously
> working features (diagnostics, etc...). __Working on reintroducing the disabled features would be a great place to start__, 
> as many of [server](../src/server.ts) providers were implemented using range based location
> calculation's to abide to their prior protocol use.
> 
> Relevant examples for each of the feature's mentioned above are included @ [wiki/sources](https://github.com/ndonfris/fish-lsp/wiki/sources#vscode-extension-examples)

[Child process](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html) execution via sub-shells. Sub-shell environment's
are extensively relied on throughout the code base.

[Markdown formatting syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/), and nested language support via triple backticks.

[Asynchronous processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_I/O) and [race conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition). Especially during [src/server.ts](../src/server.ts) startup.

Prefetching relevant information and [caching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing)) it for global use.

## Important Tooling Provided :toolbox:

- [tree-sitter](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=web-tree-sitter) - used for data structures/algorithms, prevalent to the shell language.
  - [`@ndonfris/tree-sitter-fish@3.6.0`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ndonfris/tree-sitter-fish) - handles installing the actual tree-sitter-fish.wasm package
  - [`web-tree-sitter`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/web-tree-sitter) - is the API for `SyntaxNode[]`, `Parser`, `Range`, etc...

- [eslint](https://eslint.org/) - used for linting and formatting
    -  `yarn lint` - lint and fix the current project (`husky pre-push` hook)
    -  `yarn lint:check` - check the current project 
    -  `yarn lint:verbose` - lint, and display output 

- [knip](https://github.com/webpro/knip) - used for tree-shaking and checking unused dependencies
    -  `yarn refactacor` - package.json script to run knip
    - You can _refactor_ major sections of __unused code__ of out the project easily with this command

- [commander.js](https://github.com/tj/commander.js) - used for [src/cli.ts](../src/cli.ts) and other tooling to start the server
    - Handles parsing the [./dist/fish-lsp](../dist/fish-lsp) `stdin`, in a structured manor

- [zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) - parses the `env` into a [typesafe object](https://github.com/ndonfris/fish-lsp/blob/a41b2654cc7607993b3fd80c8560e2fdcfeca6d2/src/config.ts#L86C54-L86C55)
    - handles _parsing_ the `fish_lsp*` variables in our __node__ `process.env` object
    - _builds_ the result object in the global variable `config` 

- [vscode-languageserver](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-languageserver-node) - the _SPEC_ for defining our _LSP_.
    - `Objects` & `Interfaces` specific to `fish-lsp` typically __extend__ this base specification
    - `Type Definitions` useful for handler's are defined throughout this package

- [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) - the [git-hooks](https://github.com/ndonfris/fish-lsp/blob/a41b2654cc7607993b3fd80c8560e2fdcfeca6d2/package.json#L42) for interacting with project's source code 
    - lints the project `on-push`
    - removes dependencies before commit `pre-commit`
    - initializes yarn `post-merge`

- [vitest](https://vitest.dev/) - testing the project
    - relevant locations: [tests/*.test.ts](https://github.com/ndonfris/fish-lsp/blob/master/tests), [vitest.config.ts](https://github.com/ndonfris/fish-lsp/blob/master/vitest.config.js)
    - `yarn test` runs the tests, watching for any changes, of all the `tests/*.test.ts` files, `yarn test tests/someFile.test.ts` is the designated method for watching a specific test's changes
    - `yarn test:run` is a shorthand for running vitest on all tests, or you can specify a file to test via `yarn test:run tests/someFile.test.ts` (this will not watch for changes)
    - `yarn test:coverage` is used to generate a coverage report for the project's tests
    - `yarn test:coverage:ui` is used to display the coverage report in a browser

- [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) - used for bundling the project
    - relevant locations: [scripts/build.ts](https://github.com/ndonfris/fish-lsp/blob/master/scripts/build.ts), [scripts/esbuild/*](https://github.com/ndonfris/fish-lsp/blob/master/scripts/esbuild)
    - `yarn build` runs `tsx scripts/build.ts` to create a production build of the project in the `dist/` directory. Use this command to pass flags to the `scripts/build.ts` file (see, `yarn build --help`)
    - `yarn dev` runs all build steps, and build all esbuild files, potentially with the modules and dependencies bundled
    - `yarn dev:watch` runs `yarn dev`, and watches for changes to recompile the project automatically
    - `yarn dev:watch-all` is similar to `yarn dev:watch`, but will re-run the entire `yarn dev` command on any changes in the project
    - **NOTE:** depending on the version you of the server you are targeting when building (`bin/fish-lsp`, `dist/fish-lsp`, etc...), esbuild may or may not bundle and/or embed dependencies into the final output file.

### Other Noteworthy Tooling :hammer_and_wrench:

Becoming familiar with using the `src/utils/{tree-sitter,node-types}.ts` code, is significantly easier while using the previously mentioned [TDD Workflow](#test-driven-development-workflow-hatchingchick). 

Using an equivalent tree-sitter visualization command to neovim's command, `:InspectEdit` is also highly recommended. If you are unsure what this command does, it essentially allows you to visualize the AST that tree-sitter parsed from fish input. Using this while writing test files, significantly improves the overall testing experience.

Also don't forget to make use of the [`fish-lsp` command](https://github.com/ndonfris/fish-lsp/blob/master/docs/MAN_FILE.md), to help you with debugging and testing your changes!

> `fish-lsp info --time-startup`, `fish-lsp info --check-health`,
> `fish-lsp url --sources`, `fish-lsp complete`, ___+ more...___

## Adding New Language Clients :chart_with_upwards_trend:

Generally, all that is required is using the `fish-lsp start` command, and specifying fish for attaching the server to a filetype. Any other fluff in this settings, as seen in the [JSON](../README.md#client-usage) example, is only for ease of use.

Adding new client configurations, to the [fish-lsp-client's](https://github.com/ndonfris/fish-lsp-language-clients/) repo, is greatly appreciated!

## Contributing Github Actions :recycle:

If you're trying to add a new github action to the project, please take a close look at the [scripts/*](https://github.com/ndonfris/fish-lsp/tree/master/scripts) directory, along with [package.json](https://github.com/ndonfris/fish-lsp/blob/master/package.json).

A github __action__ that uses that compiles the project, requires `fish` to be installed and setup, before `yarn` in the __action__.

The current [workflow actions](https://github.com/ndonfris/fish-lsp/tree/master/.github/workflows), are the best place to see how this is achieved.

## Got helpful scripts? :passport_control:

[Show & tell](https://github.com/ndonfris/fish-lsp/discussions) is a helpful place to document your useful configurations for working on the fish-lsp.

Displaying demos, features and other cool discoveries are also welcome :)
