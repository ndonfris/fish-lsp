High-level overview of the projectâ€™s goals, tasks, and milestones for future
releases.

Any new ideas related to the content here are welcome.

__Sections:__

- [Server Features and Providers](#server-features-and-providers) - future general features that the server provides
- [Automation and Pipelines](#automation-and-pipelines) - __CI/CD__ or __tooling__ related to the project
- [Documentation](#documentation) - modifications for the project's documentation ([wiki](https://github.com/ndonfris/fish-lsp/wiki), [README](../README.md), [site](https://fish-lsp.dev), _etc._)

## General Codebase Changes

- [x] Refactor unused [files & data-structures](https://github.com/ndonfris/fish-lsp/blob/master/src)
- [x] Read a user's specific __configuration__ they have set
  - [x] `env_variables` could be set via [zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod)
  - [x] set options via cli flags, `fish-lsp start --enable ... --disable ...`
- [ ] Supporting [fish feature flags](https://fishshell.com/docs/current/language.html#future-feature-flags) and handling proper syntax changes

## Server Features and Providers

- [ ] Add `Diagnostics`
  - [x] add a `diagnostic queue` to store diagnostics
  - [ ] enable/disable specific features:
    - [ ] __Error__ - missing `end` to block
    - [ ] __Error__ - missing `switch/case` fall through check `case '*'` or `case \*`
    - [ ] __Warning__ - prefer `command`/`builtin` prefix for commands or builtins
    - [ ] __Warning__ - missing completions file from a `functions/<file>.fish`
    - [ ] _...add more features..._
  - [ ] write verbose tests for each new diagnostic
- [ ] Add `CodeActions`
  - [ ] Create `completions` file
  - [ ] `Quickfix` diagnostic error
  - [ ] Rename autoloaded _filename_ (for a fish `function`), that doesn't have a matching function name
  - [ ] Prefer `command` prefix for possible _aliased_ shell commands.
  - [ ] Move function in `~/.config/fish/config.fish` to it's own file, `~/.config/fish/functions/<file>.fish` and call it inline.
  - [ ] `if` statement to `and`/`or` equivalent, [combiner](https://fishshell.com/docs/current/tutorial.html#combiners-and-or-not)
- [ ] Add `CodeLens` support
  - [ ] Decide what would be useful to display
- [ ] Add `CommandExecutor` provider
- [x] Add function `SignatureHelp` provider.
    - [ ] semi complete, needs more support
- [ ] `FormatOnType` provider (useful for small files)
- [ ] Enable server via __shebang's__:
  - [ ] `#!/usr/bin/fish`
  - [ ] `#!/usr/local/bin/fish`
  - [ ] `#!/usr/bin/env fish`
- [ ] Add `DocumentHighlight` provider
- [ ] Extend symbol definitions recognized by the server:
  - [ ] variables created by `fish_opt` && `argparse` commands
  - [ ] `alias` names
  - [ ] `abbr` names
  - [ ] include [theme variables](https://fishshell.com/docs/current/interactive.html#envvar-fish_color_normal)
  - [ ] event handlers for `function _ --on-event event`
  - [ ] universal variables
- [ ] Descriptions for array indexing: `echo $PATH[-1..2]`
  - [ ] ensure array indexes are: `1 >= idx <= -1`
- [ ] `source` command use cases, for workspaces outside of default
      configurations. (The `source` command, can be used similar to import in other
      languages)
- [x] [status variable](https://fishshell.com/docs/current/language.html#the-status-variable) documentation
     > ```text
     > 0 is generally the exit status of commands if they successfully performed the requested operation.
     > 1 is generally the exit status of commands if they failed to perform the requested operation.
     > 121 is generally the exit status of commands if they were supplied with invalid arguments.
     > 123 means that the command was not executed because the command name contained invalid characters.
     > 124 means that the command was not executed because none of the wildcards in the command produced any matches.
     > 125 means that while an executable with the specified name was located, the operating system could not actually execute the command.
     > 126 means that while a file with the specified name was located, it was not executable.
     > 127 means that no function, builtin or command with the given name could be located.
     >```
- [ ] Options to enable from client configuration
