_

    the name of the currently running command (though this is deprecated, and the use of status current-command is preferred).

argv

    a list of arguments to the shell or function. argv is only defined when inside a function call, or if fish was invoked with a list of arguments, like fish myscript.fish foo bar. This variable can be changed.

CMD_DURATION

    the runtime of the last command in milliseconds.

COLUMNS

    the current size of the terminal in width. These values are only used by fish if the operating system does not report the size of the terminal. Both variables must be set in that case otherwise a default of 80x24 will be used. They are updated when the window size changes.

LINES

    the current size of the terminal in height. These values are only used by fish if the operating system does not report the size of the terminal. Both variables must be set in that case otherwise a default of 80x24 will be used. They are updated when the window size changes.

fish_kill_signal

    the signal that terminated the last foreground job, or 0 if the job exited normally.

fish_killring

    a list of entries in fish’s kill ring of cut text.

fish_read_limit

    how many bytes fish will process with read or in a command substitution.

fish_pid

    the process ID (PID) of the shell.

history

    a list containing the last commands that were entered.

HOME

    the user’s home directory. This variable can be changed.

hostname

    the machine’s hostname.

IFS

    the internal field separator that is used for word splitting with the read builtin. Setting this to the empty string will also disable line splitting in command substitution. This variable can be changed.

last_pid

    the process ID (PID) of the last background process.

PWD

    the current working directory.

pipestatus

    a list of exit statuses of all processes that made up the last executed pipe. See exit status.

SHLVL

    the level of nesting of shells. Fish increments this in interactive shells, otherwise it simply passes it along.

status

    the exit status of the last foreground job to exit. If the job was terminated through a signal, the exit status will be 128 plus the signal number.

status_generation

    the “generation” count of $status. This will be incremented only when the previous command produced an explicit status. (For example, background jobs will not increment this).

TERM

    the type of the current terminal. When fish tries to determine how the terminal works - how many colors it supports, what sequences it sends for keys and other things - it looks at this variable and the corresponding information in the terminfo database (see man terminfo). Note: Typically this should not be changed as the terminal sets it to the correct value.

USER

    the current username. This variable can be changed.

EUID

    the current effective user id, set by fish at startup. This variable can be changed.

version

    the version of the currently running fish (also available as FISH_VERSION for backward compatibility).
